A set of specialized, fun, exchangeable plug-and-play modules
for the open source cargo bike "XYZ Cargo" (developed by Till Wolfer and the N55 collective),

The uses of modules are infinite, from powering a mobile sewing workshop to creating a mobile cinema unit
that will allow to screen films and documentaries in the least expected places.
